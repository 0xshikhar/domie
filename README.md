# Domie - Where Web3 Domains Escape the Void

> *You spent 0.5 ETH on a premium domain. Listed it on a marketplace. Waited. Checked back daily. Nothing. Not a single view. Not a single offer. Your domain sits in a React SPA that Google can't see, buried in a list nobody scrolls through. Meanwhile, someone searching "premium crypto domains" on Google finds... nothing. Your domain might as well not exist.*

**This is the reality for 90% of Web3 domain owners.**

---

## The Story Behind Domie

We watched domain owners struggle with three fundamental problems:

**The Invisibility Problem** ‚Üí A seller lists `crypt.ai` for 2 ETH. It's a perfect domain‚Äîshort, memorable, premium keyword. But it's on a React SPA marketplace. Google can't index it. Buyers searching for "ai domains" never find it. Six months later, it's still unsold.

**The Friction Problem** ‚Üí A buyer finally discovers the domain through Discord. They want to negotiate. Now they're jumping between: the marketplace (to check price), their wallet (to make an offer), Telegram (to message the owner), back to the marketplace (to complete the purchase). By the time they navigate this maze, they've lost interest.

**The Access Problem** ‚Üí A group of 10 friends want to buy `metaverse.com` for 50 ETH. Each can afford 5 ETH, but there's no way to pool funds and share ownership. The domain goes to a whale instead. Premium domains stay out of reach for regular users.

**We built Domie to fix all three.**

## What Domie Does

Domie is a complete solution for DOMA domain sales and communication that combines:

**üéØ SEO-Optimized Landing Pages** ‚Üí Every domain gets a dedicated, server-rendered page that Google actually indexes. When someone searches for your domain, they find it‚Äîwith pricing, analytics, and a buy button.

**üí¨ XMTP In-Chat Trading** ‚Üí Complete negotiations and purchases inside decentralized chat. Send a trade card, buyer clicks "Buy Now," transaction completes. No app switching. No friction.

**ü§ù Community Deals & Fractionalization** ‚Üí Pool funds with others to buy expensive domains. Get proportional ERC-1155 tokens. Vote on when to sell. Split profits automatically.

**Result:** Domains get discovered, deals close faster, premium domains become accessible.

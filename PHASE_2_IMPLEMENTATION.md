## ðŸŽ¨ Integration Points

### Domain Landing Page
The domain landing page now includes:
1. **Share Section** - Enhanced with full ShareButtons component
2. **Price Intelligence** - Full price chart and analytics below domain details
3. **Activity Feed** - Domain-specific activity stream at bottom

### Navigation
- Added "Activity" link to main navigation
- Accessible from all pages
- Icon-based navigation

### API Structure
```
/api/activity          - Activity feed CRUD
/api/analytics/price   - Price intelligence data
```

---

## ðŸ“Š Database Schema (Already Exists)

The implementation leverages existing Prisma schema:
- **Activity** model - For activity feed
- **DomainAnalytics** model - For price tracking
- **Domain** model - Core domain data
- **User** model - User relationships

---

## ðŸš€ How to Use

### Activity Feed
```typescript
// In any component
import ActivityFeed from '@/components/activity/ActivityFeed';

// All activities
<ActivityFeed showFilters={true} limit={20} />

// User-specific
<ActivityFeed userId={userId} showFilters={true} />

// Domain-specific
<ActivityFeed domainId={domainId} showFilters={false} limit={10} />
```

### Price Chart
```typescript
import PriceChart from '@/components/analytics/PriceChart';

<PriceChart
  domainName={domain.name}
  domainId={domain.id}
  tld={domain.tld}
/>
```

### Share Buttons
```typescript
import ShareButtons from '@/components/social/ShareButtons';

<ShareButtons
  domainName={domain.name}
  price={domain.price}
  currency={domain.currency}
  description={domain.description}
/>
```

### Creating Activities
```typescript
import { createDomainListedActivity } from '@/lib/activityHelper';

// When a domain is listed
await createDomainListedActivity(
  domainId,
  domainName,
  price,
  currency,
  userId
);
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

To fully leverage these features:

1. **Integrate Activity Creation**
   - Add activity creation to domain listing flow
   - Add activity creation to offer acceptance
   - Add activity creation to deal creation/funding

2. **Populate Price Data**
   - Seed historical price data for testing
   - Track all price changes in analytics

3. **Test Social Sharing**
   - Test Twitter integration
   - Test embed codes
   - Test on mobile devices

4. **Analytics Enhancement**
   - Add more price prediction algorithms
   - Integrate external market data
   - Add trend indicators

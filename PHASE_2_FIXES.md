# Phase 2 Features - Fixes & Enhancements

## Issues Fixed âœ…

### 1. Activity Feed - User Activity Not Showing
**Problem**: When clicking "My Activity", no activities were displayed even for authenticated users.

**Root Cause**: The API was expecting `userId` (database ID) but receiving `walletAddress` from the frontend.

**Solution**: Updated `/api/activity/route.ts` to:
- Accept wallet address as `userId` parameter
- Look up user by wallet address (case-insensitive)
- Filter activities by the found user's database ID
- Return empty array if user not found

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/api/activity/route.ts` - Fixed user lookup logic

### 2. Price Intelligence - Empty Data & Poor Design
**Problem**: Price charts showed "No price history available" and all stats were 0.0000 ETH.

- No historical price data in database

## How It Works

### Price Prediction Algorithm

1. **Base Price Calculation**:
   ```
   Base = 1.0 ETH
   Ã— Length multiplier (3-char = 10x, 4-5 char = 5x, etc.)
   Ã— TLD multiplier (eth = 2x, crypto = 1.8x, etc.)
   Ã— Keyword bonus (contains 'ai', 'crypto', etc. = 2x)
   Ã— Penalties (numbers = 0.6x, hyphens = 0.5x)
   ```

2. **Market Trend Adjustment**:
   ```
   Final Price = Base Price Ã— Trend Multiplier
   - Bullish: 1.3x
   - Neutral: 1.0x
   - Bearish: 0.8x
   ```

3. **Recommendation Logic**:
   ```
   Ratio = Current Price / Predicted Price
   - < 0.7: UNDERPRICED (strong buy)
   - 0.7-0.9: BUY
   - 0.9-1.1: HOLD
   - 1.1-1.3: SELL
   - > 1.3: OVERPRICED
   ```

### Example Analysis

**Domain**: `ai.doma` (Price: 2.5 ETH)

**Characteristics**:
- Length: 2 (ultra-short) â†’ +80% impact
- TLD: doma â†’ 1.5x multiplier
- Keyword: "ai" â†’ +60% impact
- No numbers/hyphens â†’ No penalties

**Prediction**:
- Base Price: 15 ETH (1.0 Ã— 10 Ã— 1.5 Ã— 2)
- Market: Bullish â†’ 19.5 ETH
- Current: 2.5 ETH
- Ratio: 0.13 â†’ **UNDERPRICED**
- Confidence: 85%

**Recommendation**: Strong buy opportunity!
